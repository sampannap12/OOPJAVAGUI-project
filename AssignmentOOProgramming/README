## Overview
The software is designed to allow a user to open the application, import their cleaned [TFI Bus Stop](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/b61d8abf-efd1-4476-a29b-afc8c2edd6ba/resource/6db74b2d-c7d3-4faf-a922-851c042715ba) results, and display filtered views with row counts for each question.

## Classes
### Control
This class was used to start the software by introducing a new graphical user interface.
```java
new GUI();
```

### GUI
The user communicates with the software in this class.
It is largely based on the following: 
- Buttons for different activities
- A table displaying the content and requests of the users
- Checkbox for extra usability 
- Text fields/areas for user input and device output

Using the `GridBagLayout`, each attribute is shown in the GUI.
Then, for each button, there is an `ActionListener` that will invoke other classes to perform an operation.


### ConnectionInfo

This class serves as a repository for all of the "global variables".
This class serves as a repository for all of the "global variables".



### Filter
This class adds the user's feedback from the text field to the setRowFilter, which then updates the table's output.

### LoadData
The values loaded from the CSV file will be inserted into the table view by this class.


### SaveData
This class will read the contents of the CSV file and inject them into the database related to the program.

The SaveData class is only named by the bt_import_file class, which can only be allowed until a CSV file has been chosen and loaded into the table display. The class can then be accessed, where it transforms the contents of the table into SQL INSERT statements using a while loop.

### SortDataAs
These classes simply use a SortKey and a TableRowSorter, as well as a column ID defined by the associated button operation, to sort the table view.

## Additional Information
### Database Configuration
There is a.sql file that will build the required table with the following fields:

- StopNumber 
- NamewithoutLocality 
- Locality
- Name
- Easting
- Northing



## Brief
**2. Data Explorer**  

Data analysis is a major area within Computer Science. Apart from the Big Data generated by social media and internet generally – there is an insatiable desire on behalf of companies to analyse their data in order to reveal “knowledge” hidden in the data. For example, an Optical chain analysed their sales data to determine that sales of high-end high-profit glasses peaked on Friday afternoons – so they made sure that they had enough staff to service this demand.  

The Irish Government have put 1000s of datasets into public use at a portal site: [https://data.gov.ie/data](https://data.gov.ie/data)

This has data about a whole plethora of public interests and government control information e.g. about crime rates, hospitals, schools, transport, environment, energy use and so on.

The purpose of this project is to take **ONE** of these datasets – and build a tool that shows interesting facts from the dataset. The dataset formats include Comma Separated (CSV) which is probably the easier to work at – so these datasets are at: https://data.gov.ie/data/search?res_format=CSV

You don’t have to use the full dataset if it is too big. But to query it, you will need to LOAD the dataset, or a subset of it, into a relational database yourself – and get a connection working between your java code and the database (using JDBC).

Your project will need to have a GUI that allows query parameters to be put in.

**Extras**
- Ability to see the results through the GUI too.
- Flexible queries – not just one or two hardcoded
- Whatever else you decide might enhance the application
